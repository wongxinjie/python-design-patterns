##### Problems solved by the Facade pattern
The problems solved by the Facade pattern are as follows:
* The pattern makes a software library easier to use and test, since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks
* Reduces dependency of using external code, related to the facade codebut unrelated to the client code
* Provides a better and clearer API for the client code

##### Advantages of the Facade design pattern
Let's look at the advantages of the facade design pattern:
* It maintains loose coupling between client and subsystems
* It provides an interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem (without changing them)
* It wraps a complicated subsystem with a simplier interface
* Subsystem implementation gains flexibility and clients gain simplicity
