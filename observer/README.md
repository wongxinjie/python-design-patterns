##### Use of the Observer pattern
The Observer pattern is used when a change in one object leads to a change in other objects, and you don't know how many objects should be changed.

##### Advantages of the Observer pattern
The Observer design pattern has the following advantages:
* Maintaining a loose coupling between Sject and Observers. The Subject concrete class, details of implementation, and so on.
* Ability of broadcast messaging between Subject and Observers.
* The number of Observers can be changed at runtime.
* The Subject can keep any number of Observers.
