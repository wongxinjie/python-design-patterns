##### Abstract Factory versus Factory Method
Let's look at the instances where we need to use the Abstract Factory or Factory Method.
* Use the Factory Method pattern when there is a need to decouple a client from a particular product it uses. Use the Factory Method to relieve a client of the responsibility of creating and configuring instances of a product.
* Use the Abstract Factory pattern when clients mustbe decoupled from the product classes. The Abstract Factory pattern can also enforce constraints specifying which classes must be used with others, creating independent dsfamilies of objects.
